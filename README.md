- Step 2 calculating the frequency : Understanding how often each customer makes an purchase
- Step 3 calculating the recency : Measure the time since each customer's last purchase
- Step 4 Merging RFM Metrics
- Step 5 : Categorizing Customers
- Step 6 : Recommendations

### Outcome
- Out of 4300 unique customers 26% are potential loyalists and 18% champions
- 8% of the customers are at risk
